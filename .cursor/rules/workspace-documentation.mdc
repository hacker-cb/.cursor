# Workspace Documentation Guidelines

## README.md

Keep README.md focused on:
- Project structure overview
- Links to important files and documentation
- Brief, scannable format

## This Workspace (`.cursor/`)

Workspace-specific rules for maintaining this Cursor configuration repository.

### `.cursor/rules/` - Workspace Rules

Guidelines for maintaining this workspace:
- **Scope**: This workspace only
- **Purpose**: Enforce universal, framework-agnostic standards for content in this repository
- **Not synced**: These rules stay in this workspace
- **Examples**: command-files.mdc, rules-files.mdc, git-only-policy.mdc

## Shared Resources

Common resources distributed to all developer projects.

### `commands/` - Shared Commands

Development workflow templates:
- **Scope**: Generic, reusable workflow commands
- **Purpose**: Common development tasks applicable to any project
- **Usage**: Referenced directly or copied to project workflows
- **Examples**: init-cursor-rules.md, code-review.md, security-audit.md

### `rules/` - Shared Rules

Universal development guidelines:
- **Scope**: Framework-agnostic, language-neutral best practices
- **Purpose**: Synced to projects via `sync-shared-rules` command
- **Target**: Any developer project regardless of tech stack
- **Content**: Rules and commands management, version control, planning, code quality, testing, security, documentation, environment

## Key Distinction

- **This workspace rules** (`.cursor/rules/`) - enforce universal standards FOR this repository
- **Shared resources** (`commands/`, `rules/`) - provide universal guidelines and workflows TO other projects
