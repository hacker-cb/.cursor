# Workspace Documentation Guidelines

## README.md

Keep README.md focused on:
- Project structure overview
- Links to important files and documentation
- Brief, scannable format

## DEVELOPER_RULES.md

This file contains universal AI development best practices:
- **Project-independent** - works for any tech stack
- **Framework-agnostic** - not tied to specific tools
- **General principles** - applicable across languages and platforms
- **Consultative approach** - suggest options with benefits, let user decide

When updating DEVELOPER_RULES.md:
- Keep rules generic and widely applicable
- Use examples from multiple ecosystems (Python, Node.js, Ruby, etc.)
- Focus on principles over specific implementations
- Maintain clear section organization
