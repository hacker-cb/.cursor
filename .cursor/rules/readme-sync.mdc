# README.md Sync Rule

## Purpose

Keep README.md in sync with command files in `commands/` directory. Automatically update the README table when command files are added, modified, renamed, or deleted.

## How It Works

**When command files change:**
1. Extract description from the `## Overview` section
2. Update the corresponding row in README.md table
3. Maintain table format: `| [**command-name**](commands/filename.md) | Description |`

**Operations:**
- **New command** → Add new table row
- **Modified command** → Update description in table
- **Renamed command** → Update link and name in table
- **Deleted command** → Remove table row

## Example

Command file `commands/new-command.md`:
```markdown
# New Command

## Overview
This command does something useful.
```

Becomes table row in README.md:
```markdown
| [**new-command**](commands/new-command.md) | This command does something useful. |
```

## Automation

Update README.md automatically when command files change. No permission needed.
