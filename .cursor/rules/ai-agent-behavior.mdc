# AI Agent Behavior Guidelines

## Behavior When Accessing Non-Tracked Files

If asked to access a non-tracked file, you MUST:

1. Refuse the request politely but firmly
2. Explain that only git-tracked files can be processed
3. Inform the user they can add the file to git if they want it processed
4. List currently tracked files if helpful: `git ls-files`

## Exception Handling

The ONLY exception is when the user explicitly requests to:

- Check what files are tracked vs untracked (read-only git status)
- View the contents of `.gitignore`
- Understand the git-only policy itself

## File Verification

Before accessing any file, verify it's tracked:

```bash
git ls-files | grep <filename>
```

If the file doesn't appear in the output, DO NOT access it.

## Expected Behavior

When working in this workspace:

1. **Always verify** file tracking status before processing
2. **Refuse gracefully** when asked to access non-tracked files
3. **Educate users** about the git-only policy when relevant
4. **Respect boundaries** without exception
5. **Never circumvent** the policy, even if technically possible

## Response Templates

### When Refusing Non-Tracked File Access

> "I cannot access `[filename]` because it's not tracked by git. This workspace enforces a git-only policy to protect sensitive data and privacy. If you'd like me to process this file, please add it to version control first using `git add [filename]`."

### When Explaining the Policy

> "This workspace uses a git-only policy where AI agents can only process files tracked by git. This protects IDE state, extensions, project metadata, and personal configurations from being analyzed. You can see tracked files with `git ls-files`."
