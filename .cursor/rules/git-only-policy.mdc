# Git-Only Processing Policy

## Core Principle: Git-Tracked Files Only

You MUST only read, process, analyze, or suggest changes to files that are tracked by git version control. This is a strict security and privacy requirement.

## Mandatory Rules

### 1. File Access Restrictions

- **ONLY** access files that are tracked by git (listed in `git ls-files`)
- **NEVER** read, analyze, or process files that are:
  - Not tracked by git
  - Listed in `.gitignore`
  - Untracked in the working directory
  - Part of IDE state, extensions, or temporary data

### 2. Git Operations Prohibition

- **NEVER** use `git add` to stage files
- **NEVER** add files to git version control
- **NEVER** modify `.gitignore` without explicit user request
- The user is solely responsible for deciding what gets tracked by git

## Policy Summary

✅ **DO**: Process git-tracked files only  
✅ **DO**: Refuse non-tracked file access politely  
✅ **DO**: Explain the policy when needed

❌ **DON'T**: Access non-tracked files  
❌ **DON'T**: Add files to git  
❌ **DON'T**: Circumvent this policy

**User controls version control. AI respects boundaries.**
