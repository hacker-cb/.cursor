# Setup New Feature

## Overview
Systematically set up a new feature from requirements gathering through implementation structure and testing strategy.

## Steps

### 1. Define Requirements
- Clarify feature scope and goals with stakeholders
- Identify user stories with acceptance criteria
- List functional and non-functional requirements
- Determine success metrics
- Identify potential edge cases

### 2. Plan Technical Approach
- Review existing architecture patterns
- Identify affected modules and components
- Determine data model changes needed
- Plan API endpoints or interfaces
- Consider performance implications
- Identify security considerations
- Assess impact on existing features

### 3. Create Feature Branch
- Branch from main/master/develop
- Use descriptive branch name
- Set up local development environment
- Verify base branch tests pass

### 4. Design Architecture
- Design or update data models
- Plan API contracts and interfaces
- Sketch UI components and user flow
- Identify reusable components
- Plan state management approach
- Consider error handling strategy

### 5. Plan Testing Strategy
- Identify unit test requirements
- Plan integration test scenarios
- Consider end-to-end test cases
- Determine test data needs
- Plan manual testing checklist

### 6. Add Dependencies if Needed
- Research and evaluate libraries
- Check compatibility with existing stack
- Add dependencies to manifest
- Update documentation with new dependencies
- Verify license compatibility

### 7. Create Implementation Structure
- Create placeholder files and directories
- Set up basic module structure
- Add initial interfaces or types
- Create test file stubs
- Add comments outlining implementation steps

### 8. Document Plan
- Update project documentation
- Add feature description to changelog
- Document architectural decisions
- Note any breaking changes
- Update API documentation
