# Security Audit

## Overview
Comprehensive security review to identify and fix vulnerabilities in dependencies, code, authentication, data handling, and infrastructure configuration.

## Steps

### 1. Dependency Audit
- Scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Check for outdated packages with security patches
- Review third-party dependency licenses
- Identify unused or unnecessary dependencies
- Verify dependency sources are trustworthy
- Check for dependency confusion vulnerabilities
- Update vulnerable packages

### 2. Secrets and Credentials Scan
- Scan codebase for hardcoded secrets
- Check for API keys, passwords, tokens in code
- Review environment variable usage
- Verify secrets not in version control history
- Check for secrets in configuration files
- Ensure proper gitignore coverage
- Scan for accidentally committed credentials

### 3. Authentication Review
- Review authentication implementation
- Check password hashing strength
- Verify session management security
- Check for secure cookie flags
- Review token generation and validation
- Verify multi-factor authentication if present
- Check account lockout mechanisms
- Review password reset flow security

### 4. Authorization Review
- Audit authorization logic
- Check for privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- Verify role-based access control
- Review API endpoint permissions
- Check for insecure direct object references
- Verify user can only access own data
- Review admin functionality protection

### 5. Input Validation Audit
- Check all user input validation
- Review SQL injection prevention
- Verify XSS protection
- Check for command injection vulnerabilities
- Review file upload validation
- Check path traversal prevention
- Verify data sanitization before output

### 6. Data Handling Review
- Review sensitive data storage
- Check encryption at rest
- Verify encryption in transit
- Review PII handling practices
- Check data retention policies
- Verify secure data deletion
- Review logging practices for sensitive data

### 7. API Security Audit
- Review API authentication
- Check rate limiting implementation
- Verify CORS configuration
- Review API input validation
- Check for mass assignment vulnerabilities
- Verify proper error responses
- Review API versioning security

### 8. Infrastructure Security
- Review environment configuration
- Check access control lists
- Audit network security rules
- Verify secure defaults
- Check for exposed debug endpoints
- Review deployment security
- Verify secure communication channels

### 9. Code Security Patterns
- Check error handling for information leakage
- Review random number generation
- Verify cryptographic practices
- Check for timing attack vulnerabilities
- Review deserialization security
- Check for race conditions
- Verify secure defaults throughout

### 10. Generate Security Report
- Compile findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- List vulnerabilities with affected code locations
- Provide remediation steps for each issue
- Prioritize fixes by risk level
- Offer to fix issues interactively
- Document security improvements

## Best Practices

### Scanning
- Use automated security scanning tools
- Check dependency advisories
- Review security best practices for frameworks
- Consider OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
- Scan both source and dependencies

### Remediation
- Fix critical issues immediately
- Update dependencies to patched versions
- Implement defense in depth
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Use framework security features
